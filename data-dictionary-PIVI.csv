Variable label,Variable name,Measurement unit,Allowed values,Definition,Description
study_no,study number,categorical number,positive whole numbers,Unique identifier for each study,Studies are numbered alphabetically. 
reference,short-hand notation for reference,categorical text,"text; author(s), year of publication",Unique identifier for each study,A shorthand to refer readers to the bibliography citation
lat,latitude,decimal format degrees,-90 to 90,Latitude of study location,"Identifies geographic location of study, either extracted directly from text or estimated based on description of location "
long,longitude,decimal format degrees,-180 to 180,Longitude of study location,"Identifies geographic location of study, either extracted directly from text or estimated based on description of location "
data_type,data type with respect to weed sampling,categorical text,"RM, LAST, AVG",RM=repeated measures; LAST=last measurement; AVG=average of multiple years' measurements,RM=the study measured weed responses over many years and reported values for multiple years; LAST=the study reports only the last measurement year values; AVG=the study reports a weed response averaged over more than one year
reps,replicates,count,positive integer, The number of replicated treatments in the study.,This is the physical number of replicates that were present every year for a given study. 
sys_tillage,tillage classification of study,categorical text,"NT, tilled, IC",NT=zero-tillage; tilled=tillage; IC=it's complicated,"NT=no tillage was used over the course of the study; tilled=some form of tillage was used during the study; IC=the tillage may have changed, was not clear, did not have a distinct classifcation, or had some other complicating feature"
sys_weedmgmt,type of weed management used in study,categorical text,"herbicide, none, mechanical, herb/mech, IC",herbicide = only herbicides; none = no weed control; mechanical = only mechanical (includes tillage and hand weeding; herb/mech = a combination of herbicides and mechanical; IC = it's complicated,"IC=the tools used may have changed category, were not clear, did not have a distinct classifcation, or had some other complicating feature"
weedmsmt_unit,what population unit the weed measurements were done on,categorical text,"community, single species",community = weed community made up of two or more species; single species = a single weed species,Indicates whether weed biomass/density was reported for an entire weed community or a single weed species
perenYN,perennial inclusion,binary,"Y, N",Y = yes; N = no,Identifies crop rotations that include a perennial crop that remains in place for at least one full calendar year.
fallowYN,presence of fallow year,binary,"Y, N",Y = yes; N = no,"Identifies crop rotations that include a fallow period, wherein crops are not grown for a full growing season."
checkcrop,check crop,crop name,letters,See 'crop-abbreviations' csv,The crop in which weeds were measured in. 
cropseq,rotation crop sequence,crop name,"letters, dashes",See 'crop-abbreviations' csv,The sequence of crops grown in the rotation. The crop the value was measured in appearing last in the sequence. Note the last crop abbreviation in the sequence should match the checkcrop column. 
rotlen_yrs,crop rotation length,years,positive numeric,The length of time in years to complete one full rotation. ,"This was calculated from the 'soil's' perspective, as how much time elapses between patterns of crops. For example a wheat-maize-wheat rotation would have a rotation length of 2 years. "
species_nu,number of crop species in rotation,number,positive integer,The number of unique crop species present in the rotation.,"Note this includes cover crop species if they were present in the rotation. For diverse mixtures of cover crops/pasture we counted it as one species unit, as we felt it was unfair to infalte the species richness calculations based on functionally similar species being grown together as a unit."
PICV,planting-interval-coefficient-of-variation,number,numeric; NA,Coefficient of variation in number of months between planting events in one complete rotation cycle.,The number of months between planting events for one complete rotation cycle was extracted. The standard deviation and mean value were calculated. The coefficient of variation (CV) of months between plantings was calculated for each rotation. 
studyage_yrs,study age,years,positive numeric; NA,The age of the study at the time of reported measurements,"The year of experimental establishment is set as year 0, and each subsequent year adds 1 to this value. If more than one crop is grown during a year this value may be a fraction. If the values were averaged over many years then this represents the average study age, and may therefore be a fraction. "
weed_bio,weed biomass,grams per square meter,positive numeric; NA,Measured weed biomass,"This is the total weed biomass and gives no information about the composition of the weeds that were measured. All values were converted to grams per square meter, regardless of how they were originally reported. NA indicates this study did not report weed biomass."
weed_bioSE,standard error of weed biomass value,grams per square meter,positive numeric; blank space indicates value was not reported,Standard error of the weed biomass value recorded. ,This value was recorded only if the authors reported it in the manuscript. 
weed_den,weed density,plants per square meter,positive numeric; NA,Measured weed density,"This is the total number of weeds and gives no information about the composition of the weeds that were measured. All values were converted to plants per square meter, regardless of how they were originally reported. NA indicates this study did not report weed density."
weed_denSE,standard error of weed density value,plants per square meter,positive numeric; NA,Standard error of the weed density value recorded. ,This value was recorded only if the authors reported it in the manuscript.
